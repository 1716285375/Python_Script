# Python_Script
# This script was coded in python to merge EXCEL when you have to deal with some DATETYPE data (default the first column), but the raw data is STRTYPE.
# you can merge a single excel file or even more, it's default appended the first excel when you merge several excel files.
# meanwhile you can change the code where under the comment to customize your personal deman.
# In the end, welcome to issue for the script if you have some brilliant insights.
